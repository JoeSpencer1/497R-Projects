# 497R Projects

This repository contains all of the codes I create for my ME EN 497R research with the Flow Lab.
The folder labeled "LeapFrog" contains the leapfrogging vortices program I completed at the beginning of the course.
The folder labeled "Airfoil Analysis" contains the second project, which uses Xfoil.jl.
The folder labeled "Rotor Analysis" contains the third project, which introduced CCBlad.jl.
The folder labeled "Rotor Design" contains the forth project, in which I use SNOW.jl to optimize a rotor.
