# LeapFrog1
This is my pre-semester leapfrogging vortices code.
I still have not quite figured out the proper syntax for Git version control. I had actually saved each version as a new file the first time I tried this. This time I will copy/paste my code each time so there is only one LeapFrog code. Because there are not very and they are mostly simple, all of my functions are written inside of one main julia file for this code.
