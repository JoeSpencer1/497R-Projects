# 497R Projects

This repository contains all of the codes I create for my ME EN 497R research with the Flow Lab. The branch labeled "LeapFrog" contains the leapfrogging vortices program I completed at the beginning of the course. The branch labeled "Airfoil-Analysis" Contains the second project, which uses Xfoil.jl.
